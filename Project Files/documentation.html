<p>In data analytics, a "story" typically refers to a structured narrative or explanation created to communicate the insights, findings, and meaning derived from data analysis. A data analytics story is a way of presenting data-driven insights in a more relatable and comprehensible form, often to inform decision-makers, stakeholders, or a broader audience.
While Storytelling relates to a literary term, it’s use in Data Visualizations is similar to literature. We weave stories and tell them in ways that can make the story very interesting and can show you the various characters and the plot of the story and the importance of each and every character and element in the story. That helps us understand the story in a way that’s better than usual and can help it stick with us to recite to anyone else as and how it was understood by us. All in all, it is done to enhance the effect a usual story has on the reader.

Think of the same thing but in a Data Visualization scenario and place the characters in your mindset to be the multiple variables contributing to the story, the plot of the story to be the baseline we’re trying to explain or the situation a company is facing or just another scenario. The story is told about the various characters and how they impact the plot which is shown specifically using annotations as we’ll understand ahead</p>
